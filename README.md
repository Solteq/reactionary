# Reactionary

## Contributing

### Running locally

The includes examples generally require .env to be configured with the relevant API keys. We can likely create a setup for this in Vault, for easy bootstrapping.

### Pull requests

For new features, branch from main and create a pull request towards main upon feature completion. Please observe the following guidelines:

- Preserve a linear history. This means rebasing on main, rather than merging. PR's containing merge commits should be considered unmergeable.
- Observe semantic commit message guidelines for the rebased pull request commits.
- Ensure that the PR is linked to an issue.
